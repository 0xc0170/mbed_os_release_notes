## How We Release Arm Mbed OS

[A document about the release process for Mbed OS.]

Note to self: This should probably include testing, release candidates and release notes. We should also include the differences among major, feature and patch releases.

The three types of Arm Mbed OS releases are major releases, feature releases and patch releases. Major releases happen infrequently and indicate a change in the structure of the OS. In major releases, the first number after "Mbed OS" changes. For example, moving to Arm Mbed OS 5.0 was a major release. Feature releases occur about once a quarter. As their name suggests, feature releases introduce new features to the code base. Patch releases occur about once every two weeks. They include bug fixes and additional target support.
